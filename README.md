# WELCOME TO FRINGELY!

Fringely is a forum for girls who love their fringe (aka bangs).

This project was created over five days. Below is an image of my ERD before starting the project.

Fringely was created using Ruby, Sinatra, and Skeleton.

This is a work in progress and other elements will be added.

**Thank you**
